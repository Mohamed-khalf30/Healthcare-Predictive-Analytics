Healthcare Predictive Analytics (Machine Learning Project)

Data Collection: Acquired dataset from Kaggle.
Data Wrangling & Cleaning:
Checked data types, handled missing values, and removed duplicates.
Addressed data imbalance and dropped unnecessary columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted in-depth data exploration to uncover patterns and relationships.
Utilized visualization tools like Plotly Express, Seaborn, and Matplotlib (e.g., heatmaps, pie charts) to extract meaningful insights.
Feature Selection: Applied XGBoost to identify the top 10 most important features.
Model Training & Optimization:
Experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms and selected the top three models.
Performed hyperparameter tuning using Randomized Search.
Finalized Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with optimized parameters, achieving:
97.74% accuracy on training data
98.88% accuracy on test data
Evaluated model performance using ROC Curve to ensure high reliability.
